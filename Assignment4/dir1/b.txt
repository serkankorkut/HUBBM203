abc in this paper, we propose a novel single image action
recognition algorithm which is based on the idea of semantic
body part actions. Unlike existing bottom up methods,
we argue that the human action is a combination of meaningful
body part actions. in detail, we divide human body
into five parts: head, torso, arms, hands and legs. And for
each of the body parts, we define several semantic body
part actions, hand holding, hand waving. These semantic
body part actions are strongly related to the bodye
actions, e.g., writing, and jogging. Based on the idea, we
propose a deep neural network based system: first, body
parts are localized by a Semi-FCN network. Second, for
each body parts, a Part Action Res-Net is used to predict
semantic body part actions. And finally, we use SVM to
fuse the body part actions and predict the entire body action.
Experiments on two dataset: PASCAL VOC 2012 and
Stanford40 report mAP improvement from the state-of-theart
by 545 and 345 respectively.
